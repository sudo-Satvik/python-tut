# String is immutable, i.e. we can't change the content in this!

# Strings can be created by three ways in Python:

# 1 Single quote

single_quote = 'I am single quoted string'

# 2 Double quotes

double_quote = "I am double quoted string"

# 3 Triple quotes (''') or ("""") for multi-line strings

multi_line_strings = '''I am multi line string 
I am useful for big sentences wraps
'''
