# A constant is a name used to store data that remains unchanged throughout the program.
# Python doesn't have built-in support for constants like some other languages (e.g., final in Java)

# Constants are written in uppercase letters. They are not enforced by the language; itâ€™s up to the programmer to avoid modifying them.

# Syntax: CONSTANT_NAME = value
