# for loop is used to iterate among the list, tuple or strings[iterables]

# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for item in list1:
#     print(item)

# print("=============")

# tuple1 = (1, 5, 2, 4, 3)
# for element in tuple1:
#     print(element)

# print("=============")
# string1 = "Satvik"

# for char in string1:
#     print(char)

# print("=============")

# The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number.
# range(start, stop, step_size)

# for i in range(6, 0, -1):

# FOR LOOP WITH ELSE
# An optional else can be used with a for loop if the code is to be executed when the
# loops exhausts.

for i in range(0, 11):
    print(i)
else:
    print("loop ended")

    
# Exists: break, continue and pass (pass: do nothing)
