# Python Roadmap for Generative AI and Full-Stack Integration

This roadmap focuses on the essential Python topics needed for Generative AI and integrating AI capabilities into full-stack applications. Skip unnecessary Python areas to stay efficient while building on your existing Java and JavaScript expertise.

## Core Python for AI Development
- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
- **Functions**: Defining, calling, and using lambda functions.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing and managing libraries (e.g., `os`, `sys`).

## Scientific Computing and Libraries
- **NumPy**:
  - Array creation and manipulation.
  - Linear algebra operations.
- **Pandas**:
  - Data loading and preprocessing (CSV, JSON).
  - DataFrame operations (filtering, grouping).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**:
  - Basic data visualization.

## Deep Learning with Python
- **PyTorch**:
  - Tensor operations and automatic differentiation.
  - Building and training simple neural networks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**:
  - Using pre-trained models like GPT, BERT.
  - Fine-tuning models for text and image tasks.

## Generative AI-Specific Libraries
- **Transformers**:
  - Tokenizers and model pipelines.
  - Hands-on fine-tuning.
- **Diffusers**:
  - Stable Diffusion models for image generation.
- **OpenAI API**:
  - Using GPT models for conversational AI.

## Data Handling
- **File I/O**:
  - Reading and writing CSV and JSON files.
  - Handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**:
  - Text cleaning and preprocessing.
