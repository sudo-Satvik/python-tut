# In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed

a = ()      # empty tuple
print(a)
b = (1, )   # tuple with single element needs a comma
print(b)
c = (1, 2, 3, 4, "Satvik", None, True)
print(c)

# This will throw an error
# c[0] = 2
# print(c)
